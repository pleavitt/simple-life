## About me

I am a software developer who takes pride in producing a high standard of work.  I like to 
learn from those that are a wealth of information as well as reciprocate that as I take pride
in my ability to teach concepts by simplifying in a way my audience understands.  

As a team lead I use the same concepts I have learnt from coaching youth basketball, honesty, open communication and giving ownership to the team to create a productive working environment that people be apart of.

### Personal

I was a professional online poker player for 8 years before I returned to the IT industry.
During this time I also undertook a student and I was able to teach him up to a competency level that he was able to become a professional also.  I now have 2 children and I try focus on constantly improving as a parent.
